Since Fall 2021, I am a William W. Elliott Assistant Research Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.duke.edu/ "Department of Mathematics") at Duke University, where I am working with [Veronica Ciocanel](https://services.math.duke.edu/~ciocanel/ "Veronica Ciocanel") and Michael Reed. Prior to Duke, I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Utah under the supervision of [Aaron L. Fogelson](https://math.utah.edu/~fogelson "Aaron L. Fogelson" ). I am motivated by problems at the intersection of biology and mathematics, and am interested in modeling and simulating physiological processes, such as blood coagulation, intracellular transport, and metabolism. In particular, my research interests include dynamical systems, PDEs, and parameter estimation.
