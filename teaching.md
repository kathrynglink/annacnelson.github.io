I have had the opportunity to teach a wide variety of courses at University of Utah and at Duke University. During 2018-2019, I was a recipient University Teaching Assistantship recipient from the Graduate School at Utah to continue a peer mentorship program for graduate students. 

I am passionate about teaching pedagogy and training graduate student instructors in teaching best practices. I was involved with the Utah Math Instructor Training Workshop for 3 years, which is an annual workshop that includes practice lectures, workshops on campus-wide resources, and teaching pedagogy workshops.
